# Andrew Walpole
## Principal Web Developer & Engineering manager

I have over 20 years of experience programming, and 10 years of experience teaching and leading digital designers and engineers. I take pride in leading happy, effective teams that consistently execute strategic initiatives over the long-term.

In my technical tenure, I’ve architected and built performant web applications, high-traffic websites, and countless internal tools and systems. I’m highly adaptable to new technologies and have experience across multiple front-end and back-end frameworks.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, React, Wordpress, PHP, Nuxt, Next.js, Eleventy, Node.js, NoSQL, are a few examples of tech I have a current expertise in.

I lead through setting clear expectations and establishing trust through transparent and honest bi-directional feedback. I partner with adjacent teams to best serve the business and its overall goals.
